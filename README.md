\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is my first project (and experience) working with the laser cutter. The assignment was to create something simple for the laser cutter. \
\
For my project specifically, I decided to use 123D Make to cut out a form that I 3D modeled. Considering material, I decided to experiment with mirrored red acrylic - I purchased a 1/8\'94, 12x24\'94 sheet from Inventables.\
The 3D model I created was a simple low-poly environment developed in 3ds Max. After cleaning up some edges and points in my model, I exported it into an STL file and imported that into 123D Make. Within that program, I adjusted the settings/dimensions to fit my acrylic sheet. I then experimented with different ways to slice up my model. Originally, I had the model sliced up so that each piece would lay on top of each other(vertically.) After comparing the model in 3ds Max and the one in 123D Make, I decided to slice it up horizontally, so that each piece was put together side by side. (Please refer to my WIP folder in images to see the gluing process) Once all the pieces were laser cut, I super glued each piece together with the help of engraved numbers on each piece. The piece overall looks satisfactory for my first real try to make something out of laser cut acrylic. The edges of each piece could have lined up better, however it\'92s somewhat forgivable given the jagged, low-poly look of the form. \

Final Note: Better quality images coming soon. \
